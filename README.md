# Magnetic-Dipole-Spatial-Coordinate-Inversion-Algorithm
This code demonstrates an inversion algorithm for solving the position and magnetic moment parameters of a dipole through coordinate transformation. It serves the paper titled "Magnetic Dipole Spatial Coordinate Transformation and Inversion Method" with Lu Yin as the first author, and is shared here for communication and learning purposes.
